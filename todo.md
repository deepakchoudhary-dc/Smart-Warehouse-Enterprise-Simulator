# Outstanding Tasks
- Smoke test auto-selection so the live heatmap updates without extra Run History clicks.
- Confirm replay controls operate correctly once a scenario completes.
- Monitor backend and websocket logs for congestion or repeated "Waiting to move" loops.
- Ensure run history metrics/stages sync in real time with websocket ticks.
- Populate analytics API with seeded/persisted runs so the new dashboards surface real data.
- Add automated visual regression (Playwright) capturing analytics navigation and charts.
